## 🎯 Objective

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- Aggregation functions: `SUM()`, `COUNT(DISTINCT)`
- Date functions: `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ...)`, `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM ...)`
- Grouping and sorting data using `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY`
- Identifying top-performing months using `ORDER BY ... DESC LIMIT`

## 📌 SQL Queries
